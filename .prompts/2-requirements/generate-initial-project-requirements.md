# Core Requirements Generator

First, review the project's vision and architecture documentation:

1. Read the `vision.md` file to understand:
   - Project purpose and mission
   - Success criteria and user outcomes
   - Business goals and constraints

2. Read the `architecture.md` file to understand:
   - Technology stack and framework choices
   - Design patterns and architectural decisions
   - System components and integration approach

Once you have reviewed both documents, generate requirements following these steps:

1. Extract core functional needs from the vision and technical constraints from the architecture
2. Identify key non-functional requirements based on the technology stack
3. Group requirements into logical categories
4. Assign unique reference numbers (format: REQ-[category]-[number])
5. Present requirements in this structure:

## Core Requirements for [Project Name]

### Functional Requirements

#### [Category Name]

- REQ-[CAT]-1: [Requirement description]
- REQ-[CAT]-2: [Requirement description]

#### [Another Category Name]

- REQ-[CAT]-3: [Requirement description]
- REQ-[CAT]-4: [Requirement description]

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### [Performance Category]

- REQ-NFR-1: [Requirement description]
- REQ-NFR-2: [Requirement description]

Focus on requirements that:

- Impact system architecture
- Define core functionality
- Affect technology choices
- Influence scalability needs

Keep requirements clear, concise, and actionable.
