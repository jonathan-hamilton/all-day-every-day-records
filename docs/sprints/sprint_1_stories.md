s# Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 1 establishes the complete backend infrastructure foundation to complement the React frontend completed in Project Scaffolding. This sprint focuses on PHP backend development, database architecture, and frontend-backend integration. The goal is to create a solid technical foundation that enables content features and user-facing functionality in Sprint 2.

## Sprint Goals

- **Backend Foundation**: Establish PHP API structure with proper routing and CORS support
- **Data Persistence**: Implement MySQL database schema and connection management  
- **Integration**: Connect React frontend with PHP backend enabling hybrid development mode
- **Infrastructure**: Prepare foundation for content management and user features

## User Stories

### Story S1.1: PHP Backend API Foundation

**As a** developer  
**I want to** establish the PHP backend API foundation with routing and CORS configuration  
**So that** the React frontend can communicate with the backend and support hybrid development mode

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- PHP project structure is established with proper directory organization
- Basic routing system is implemented for API endpoints
- CORS configuration supports localhost origins for hybrid development
- Environment configuration distinguishes between development and production
- Basic error handling and response formatting is implemented
- API endpoints return consistent JSON responses
- Health check endpoint is available for testing connectivity

**Dependencies:** Project Scaffolding (Complete)

**Developer Notes:**
- Implement CORS headers as documented in php-backend-cors-setup.md
- Use environment variables for configuration management
- Consider using a lightweight PHP framework or custom routing
- Ensure all endpoints follow RESTful API conventions

### Story S1.2: Database Schema Design and Connection

**As a** developer  
**I want to** design and implement the database schema with connection management  
**So that** release data and application state can be persisted reliably

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- MySQL/MariaDB database schema is designed and documented
- Database connection configuration supports environment-based settings
- Core tables are created: releases, artists, labels, streaming_links
- Database migrations system is implemented for schema changes
- Connection pooling and error handling is configured
- Database seeding capabilities are available for development data
- Backup and restore procedures are documented

**Dependencies:** S1.1 - PHP Backend API Foundation

**Developer Notes:**
- Design schema to support releases with multiple artists and streaming services
- Include proper indexing for performance on search/filter operations
- Consider foreign key relationships and data integrity constraints
- Plan for future admin user authentication tables

### Story S1.3: Frontend-Backend API Integration

**As a** developer  
**I want to** integrate the React frontend with the PHP backend API  
**So that** data can flow between frontend and backend enabling future content features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Frontend API service layer is implemented with proper TypeScript types
- Error handling manages network failures and API errors gracefully
- Loading states are implemented for API operations
- Environment configuration switches between local and production APIs
- CORS integration is validated with actual API calls
- Basic release data endpoints are functional (GET operations)
- Frontend displays confirmation of successful backend connectivity
- API timeout and retry logic is implemented

**Dependencies:** S1.1 - PHP Backend API Foundation, S1.2 - Database Schema

**Developer Notes:**
- Use fetch API or axios for HTTP communication
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Add loading spinners and error boundaries for better UX
- Validate hybrid development mode works with production backend
- Consider implementing a basic API testing component

## Integration Notes

### Technical Integration Considerations

- **CORS Configuration**: Critical for supporting hybrid development mode where React runs locally while accessing production PHP backend
- **Environment Management**: Each service (frontend, backend, database) must support environment-specific configuration
- **API Versioning**: Consider implementing API versioning strategy from the start to support future changes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all API endpoints for predictable frontend handling
- **Security**: Implement basic security headers and input validation foundation for future authentication features

### Development Workflow Integration

- **Hybrid Development Mode**: Frontend developers can work with local React + production backend
- **Full Local Mode**: Complete local stack for backend development and offline work
- **Database Management**: Direct database access for development and testing
- **Environment Configuration**: Simple environment-based configuration without container complexity

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Criteria
- All 3 stories completed with acceptance criteria validated
- Frontend successfully communicates with backend through API calls
- Database schema supports planned release management features
- CORS configuration enables hybrid development workflow

### Quality Metrics
- Zero critical bugs in API responses and error handling
- Database performance meets requirements for planned data volumes
- API response times are under 200ms for basic operations

### Integration Validation
- Hybrid development mode fully functional (local frontend + production backend)
- Full local development mode operational for backend development
- Database migrations execute without errors
- Frontend error boundaries handle backend failures gracefully

## Foundation for Next Sprint

Sprint 1 completion enables Sprint 2's content features by providing:

### Backend Infrastructure Ready
- **API Foundation**: RESTful endpoints ready for release management features
- **Database Schema**: Core tables supporting releases, artists, and streaming links
- **Development Environment**: Simple local development setup supporting rapid feature development

### Frontend Integration Complete
- **API Service Layer**: TypeScript-enabled communication with backend
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for user-facing features
- **Environment Configuration**: Seamless switching between development and production modes

### Sprint 2 Enablers
- **Release Management**: Database and API foundation ready for CRUD operations
- **Content Display**: Data persistence enables homepage carousel and release grids
- **Admin Features**: Authentication foundation prepared for content management
- **File Uploads**: Infrastructure ready for release cover image management

## Technical Rationale

### Story Selection Justification

**S1.1 - PHP Backend API Foundation**: Essential first step providing the communication layer between React frontend and data persistence. CORS configuration enables the requested hybrid development workflow.

**S1.2 - Database Schema Design**: Core data architecture must be established before any content features can be implemented. Proper schema design prevents future refactoring costs.

**S1.3 - Frontend-Backend Integration**: Validates the complete stack functionality and ensures the frontend can consume backend services. Enables immediate validation of Sprint 1 architecture decisions.

### Technical Dependencies Logic

The linear dependency chain (S1.1 → S1.2 → S1.3) ensures:
- Each story builds incrementally on previous foundation
- No story is blocked by multiple complex dependencies  
- Testing and validation can occur progressively throughout sprint
- Risk is minimized through early validation of architectural decisions

### Architecture Alignment

Sprint 1 stories directly implement requirements:
- **REQ-NFR-5**: Backend API implemented in PHP ✅
- **REQ-NFR-8**: MySQL/MariaDB for data persistence ✅  
- **REQ-DEV-1**: Hybrid development mode support ✅
- **REQ-DEV-3**: Production backend CORS configuration ✅

This sprint transforms the project from a frontend-only application into a full-stack platform ready for content management and user features.
