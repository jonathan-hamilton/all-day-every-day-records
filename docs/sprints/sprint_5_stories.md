# Sprint 5 User Stories
**Status**: 66% COMPLETE 🏗️  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Focus**: Videos System Implementation

---

## Sprint Overview
Sprint 5 expands the existing homepage video functionality into a comprehensive standalone Videos system with full CRUD capabilities. Building on the YouTube video grid component and admin infrastructure from previous sprints, this sprint creates a dedicated Videos page, implements a separate videos database table, and provides complete admin management for video content.

## Sprint Goals
1. Create standalone Videos page with navigation integration ✅
2. Implement videos database table and API endpoints separate from homepage videos ✅
3. Build admin interface for full CRUD operations on video content
4. Enable video metadata management (title, URL, description, artist)
5. Maintain consistent design patterns with existing release management system

### S5.2: Videos Database & API Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Estimate**: 6-8 hours  
**Completed**: December 13, 2025

**User Story**:  
As a system administrator, I want a separate videos database table and API endpoints so that video content can be managed independently from homepage videos.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Videos table created in database with schema: id, title, youtube_url, description, artist, created_at, updated_at
- [x] GET endpoint `/get-videos.php` returns all videos sorted by artist, then title
- [x] GET endpoint `/get-video-by-id.php?id=X` returns single video details + related videos by artist
- [x] POST endpoint `/upsert-video.php` creates or updates video records
- [x] DELETE endpoint `/delete-video.php` removes video records
- [x] All endpoints require admin authentication (except GET videos)
- [x] API returns proper JSON responses with success/error status
- [x] TypeScript interface `Video` created in `frontend/src/types/Video.ts`
- [x] VideoDetail page created with YouTube embed and related videos section
- [x] Videos page updated to fetch from new `/get-videos.php` endpoint
- [x] Clicking video navigates to VideoDetail page

**Implementation Summary**:
- ✅ Created migration `005_create_videos_table.sql` with proper schema and indexes
- ✅ Implemented 4 backend API endpoints following existing release patterns
- ✅ Created TypeScript Video types and VideoService with factory pattern
- ✅ Built VideoDetailPage component following ReleaseDetailPage structure
- ✅ Updated Videos page to use new dedicated endpoint with proper sorting
- ✅ Enhanced VideoGridItem to navigate to detail page with hover effects
- ✅ "More from [Artist]..." section displays related videos (excludes current)

**Files Created**:
- `backend/database/migrations/005_create_videos_table.sql` - Videos table migration
- `backend/api/get-videos.php` - Public endpoint for all videos
- `backend/api/get-video-by-id.php` - Public endpoint for video details + related
- `backend/api/upsert-video.php` - Admin endpoint for create/update
- `backend/api/delete-video.php` - Admin endpoint for deletion
- `frontend/src/types/Video.ts` - TypeScript Video interfaces
- `frontend/src/services/videoService.ts` - VideoService class with factory
- `frontend/src/pages/VideoDetailPage.tsx` - Video detail page component
- `docs/sprints/implementations/s5.2-implementation-plan.md` - Implementation plan

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Exported Video types
- `frontend/src/services/index.ts` - Added VideoService to factory
- `frontend/src/pages/Videos.tsx` - Updated to use new API endpoint
- `frontend/src/components/VideoGridItem.tsx` - Added navigation to detail page
- `frontend/src/pages/index.ts` - Exported VideoDetailPage
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added `/videos/:id` route
- `docs/requirements/core-requirements.md` - Updated REQ-UI-15 for Videos page
- `docs/requirements/requirements-roadmap.md` - Updated REQ-UI-15 for Videos page

**Dependencies**: S5.1 (Videos page structure) - COMPLETE ✅

**Technical Notes**:
- Database schema uses artist field (not thumbnail_url) for "More from..." functionality
- VideoDetail page simpler than ReleaseDetail (fewer metadata fields)
- Backend sorting by artist ASC, title ASC ensures consistent alphabetical display
- Related videos query excludes current video and returns only same artist
- "More from [Artist]..." section hidden when no related videos exist
- Admin interface for video management deferred to S5.3

### S5.3: Admin Videos Management Interface
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: PENDING 🔄  
**Estimate**: 8-10 hours

**User Story**:  
As an administrator, I want a complete interface for managing videos so I can create, edit, delete, and organize video content.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Admin dashboard shows "Manage Videos" section with video list
- Video list displays: thumbnail, title, YouTube URL, published status, actions
- "Add New Video" button opens video creation dialog
- Video form includes fields: title, YouTube URL, description, display order, published checkbox
- Edit functionality opens same dialog pre-populated with video data
- Delete confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Form validation ensures YouTube URL format is valid
- Success/error messages displayed after create/update/delete operations
- Video list updates immediately after successful operations
- Videos can be reordered by display_order field
- Admin can toggle published status to show/hide videos from public page

**Dependencies**: S5.2 (Videos API endpoints)

**Developer Notes**:
- Add Videos management section to `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Create `VideoManageDialog` component (similar to release management dialogs)
- Reuse existing dialog patterns from release management
- Use Material-UI Table for video list display
- Implement YouTube URL validation (basic regex check)
- Display video thumbnail preview using YouTube thumbnail API
- Follow existing admin UI patterns for consistency
- Consider adding drag-and-drop reordering in future sprint (not required now)

## Integration Notes

### Cross-Story Dependencies
1. **Navigation Integration** (S5.1): Videos link must be added to navigation in correct position
2. **API Migration** (S5.1 → S5.2): Videos page initially uses homepage endpoint, then migrates to new videos endpoint
3. **Admin Integration** (S5.3): Videos management follows same patterns as releases management for UI consistency

### Reusable Components
- `VideoGridItem`: Existing component reused for Videos page display
- Admin dialog patterns: Existing release management patterns adapted for videos
- API service factory: Videos endpoints follow existing service patterns

### Technical Considerations
- Videos table separate from homepage_videos to allow independent management
- Homepage videos remain configurable (existing functionality unchanged)
- Videos page videos can be different from homepage featured videos
- Display order field enables manual curation of video sequence

---

## Success Metrics

### Functional Completeness
- Videos page accessible and functional for all users
- Admin can perform all CRUD operations on videos
- Videos display correctly with embedded YouTube players
- Navigation updated with correct link ordering

### Technical Quality
- API endpoints follow existing security patterns
- Database schema properly normalized and indexed
- TypeScript types ensure type safety
- Error handling consistent with existing pages

### User Experience
- Videos page loads performantly
- Admin interface intuitive and follows existing patterns
- Video management workflow efficient and error-free
- Mobile responsive design maintained

---

## Foundation for Next Sprint

Sprint 5 completion enables:
- **Sprint 6**: Discography system can reuse video management patterns for dual categorization
- **Future enhancements**: Video categorization, playlists, or featured videos
- **Content expansion**: Platform ready for extensive video library growth
- **Admin efficiency**: Established patterns for managing additional content types

---

## Technical Rationale

These stories were chosen to:
1. **Build on existing infrastructure**: Leverages homepage video components and admin patterns
2. **Minimize dependencies**: Each story builds logically on the previous with clear integration points
3. **Maintain consistency**: Follows established patterns from releases management system
4. **Enable scalability**: Separate videos table allows independent growth from homepage videos
5. **Preserve functionality**: Homepage videos remain unchanged while new system is built

The three-story structure provides a clean progression: create the page, build the backend, connect the admin interface. This matches the proven pattern from Sprint 2 (releases) and Sprint 3 (admin functionality).
