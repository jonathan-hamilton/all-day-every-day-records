As an admin user I would like to be able to go to the /admin page and click a button that is close to the 'Description' text fields and have it generate a Description of the Artist/Title that is being entered.

The service will be AI Enabled and use a service like OpenAI API to lookup info and generate the Description.

Once the Description is generated it appears in the Description Text field in the /admin page for the user to edit further if necessary.

Once the Description is ready, it is persisted to the DB with the rest of the Release data.
